# Restaurant Website

## Description

After learning the basic web skills, SEO optimization, and deploying websites on hosting platforms, I moved on to learning Bootstrap, a CSS library. As an application of what I have learned, I created this simple restaurant website.

The design and concept are partly inspired by an Indian video tutorial and partly from my own design.

## Features

- Responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Clean and simple user interface.
- Easy navigation.
- Basic SEO optimization.
